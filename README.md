An approach to make math solver hosting more affordable and effective. The program allocates a portion of memory and CPU availability for solving math problems that the distance user suggests on the Harvard Math Website. The use of system resources is rewarded with DUCO digital currency, which can later be exchanged in the Duino-coin Exchange platform for BTC, ETH, or sent to a PayPal account. The program automatically encripts data and IP adresses from operations made on the host system. The program is easy to set up and is based on DUCO's PC python3 miner.

Suggested setups:

Easy difficulty: Arduino boards, Nintendo DS's and Rpi pico's

Medium: Raspberry Pi's, Orange Pi's and Rockchip SBC's

Network: Servers and Powerful PC's with a dedicated graphics card.

Below is an image explaining the aritmetic algorithm used in the script:
